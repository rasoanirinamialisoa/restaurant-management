# Restaurant Management System - README

## Introduction
This project is designed to create a backend system for managing a restaurant chain efficiently. The system will handle everything from inventory management to menu pricing dynamically.

### Project Description

This project leverages Spring Boot to implement a RESTful API for a restaurant management system. It facilitates operations such as tracking ingredient stock, managing menus, and recording transactions within different restaurant locations.

## Project Objectives
- To develop a scalable and maintainable application that meets the operational needs of managing multiple restaurants.
- To provide real-time data access and manipulation for efficient restaurant management.
- To ensure data consistency and integrity across the restaurant chain's information system.

## Project Content
The project is structured into several main components:
1. **Data Modeling** - Structuring database tables and relationships to efficiently store and retrieve data related to restaurants, menus, ingredients, and stock movements.
2. **API Development** - Building RESTful services to perform CRUD operations on the database entities and handle business logic.
3. **Authentication and Authorization** - Implementing security measures to protect the API and ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.
4. **Unit Testing** - Writing and executing tests to ensure the reliability and performance of the system components.
5. **Error Handling** - Implementing error handling across the API to manage exceptions gracefully.
